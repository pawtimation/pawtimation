Subject: Welcome to Pawtimation — Let's Get You Started

Hi there,

Thanks so much for reaching out — I'm Andrew, the founder of Pawtimation.
I'm excited to help you get set up.

Before I activate your free trial, I just need a couple of quick details so I can configure your business properly:

• Business name:
• Your full name:
• Email for your staff login:
• Approx number of clients/dogs you manage:
• Anything specific you want to test first (optional):

Once I have this, I'll switch your account on and send you:
• Your admin login
• A fully pre-loaded demo environment (if you want it)
• A quick "getting started" walkthrough
• Tips to help you get the most from your first few days

Pawtimation is designed to remove admin, streamline your business, and give you a proper CRM that grows with you — and I'm here to personally support you as you try it.

Speak soon,
Andrew
