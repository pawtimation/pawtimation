Perfect — let’s design your new footer together (no code, just the final UX + content).
This will give Replit (or any dev) a clean blueprint to implement exactly how you want it.

🌟 Your New Pawtimation Footer — Clean, Professional, Compliant

This footer is designed specifically for:
	•	SaaS businesses
	•	Early-stage startups
	•	UK home-based founders
	•	You not having a company address yet
	•	Legal compliance without exposing personal info
	•	No unused sections
	•	Brand consistency

⸻

✅ STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Your footer will have three sections:

1. Branding + Purpose

A simple block that humanises the brand.

2. Legal & Support

Clean, minimal, compliant.

3. Status + Ownership

Transparent & professional.

🧪 NOTES & CUSTOMISATIONS

✔️ No address displayed (legal & recommended at your stage)

Since you are not yet a registered Ltd company, you are legally permitted to omit a postal address.
A contact email is sufficient.

✔️ GDPR-compliant once your policies exist

When you’re ready, I will help you generate:
	•	Terms of Service
	•	Privacy Policy
	•	Cookie Policy
	•	Data Processing Agreement
	•	Support content

These will be added as pages in your frontend — not links to nowhere.

✔️ No “empty links”

Every link above will have a real page.
Nothing will be left blank.

✔️ Styled minimalist

The final footer is clean, startup-polished, and not bloated.
