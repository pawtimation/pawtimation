Here is the directive you’re looking for — something you can copy/paste into Replit’s AI, an agent, or any auditing script to make it scan your ENTIRE project and report every legal, security, compliance, and architectural gap.

This is written as a precise, strict instruction, so the tool knows exactly what to inspect and what output format to produce.

✅ COMPREHENSIVE REPLIT PROJECT AUDIT DIRECTIVE

(Copy/paste this into Replit’s AI or any code-auditing agent you’re using)

⸻

DIRECTIVE:
Perform a full-system audit of this project for legal, compliance, data-protection, security, architectural, financial, and operational risks.
Return the results in a structured, exhaustive report.
Do NOT limit the scan to specific files — inspect ALL directories, ALL code, ALL configs, ALL environment variables, and ALL user-facing text.
Your job is to find EVERYTHING we need to fix or add.

⸻

📝 Your Audit Must Cover the Following Areas:

1. File System Audit
	•	List every file that appears related to:
	•	Terms, Privacy Policy, Cookies, Legal text
	•	Policies in /public /static /assets or frontend components
	•	Footer text
	•	Any disclaimers or notices
	•	Identify missing legal documents (e.g., Terms, Privacy, DPIA, ROPA)

⸻

2. GDPR & Data Protection Compliance

For every part of the app:
	•	Identify all personal data collected or stored
	•	Identify all personal data exposed through logs or debugging
	•	Identify where the personal data flows (client → server → database)
	•	Identify where it is stored (Replit DB / Postgres / files)
	•	Identify retention logic (or absence of it)
	•	Identify if data deletion is implemented
	•	Identify if user rights (export/delete) exist
	•	Identify security controls
	•	Identify presence/absence of:
	•	Privacy Policy
	•	Terms of Service / Beta Agreement
	•	Data Retention Policy
	•	Cookie Policy
	•	Internal DPIA
	•	Internal Record of Processing Activities
	•	International transfer disclosures
	•	Third-party processor list
	•	Lawful basis for processing
	•	Age restrictions
	•	Contacts for complaints
	•	ICO complaint procedure

⸻

3. Third-Party Services Audit

Identify ALL external services used:
	•	Replit as processor (hosting, DB, deployments)
	•	Stripe (even in test mode)
	•	Email provider
	•	Analytics / trackers
	•	Libraries that transmit data externally
For each:
	•	What data do they receive?
	•	Is it declared in your privacy policy?
	•	Does the app comply with their terms?

⸻

4. API & Backend Audit

Scan backend code for:
	•	Authentication logic
	•	Authorization gaps (routes exposed without protection)
	•	Input validation or lack thereof
	•	Leaked secrets
	•	Hardcoded API keys
	•	Database permission issues
	•	Missing rate limits
	•	Missing CSRF protection
	•	Logging of personal data
	•	Debug routes left open
	•	Error messages leaking information
	•	Missing encryption
	•	Insecure file uploads (if any)

⸻

5. Database Audit

Identify:
	•	Data schemas and all personal fields stored
	•	Whether sensitive data is stored (addresses, pet info, notes, photos)
	•	Retention schedule
	•	Backup policy
	•	Whether deleted accounts are truly deleted
	•	If it uses Replit’s US-based storage (flag for GDPR)
	•	Missing indexes or performance issues
	•	Access control to DB
	•	Whether SQL injection is possible

⸻

6. Frontend/UI Audit

Identify:
	•	Any personally identifiable information displayed without need
	•	Any forms collecting unnecessary data
	•	Any missing consent (if required)
	•	Any unprotected routes
	•	Any claims in UI that are inaccurate (security claims, “fully GDPR compliant”, etc)
	•	Whether Terms/Privacy are correctly linked

⸻

7. Stripe/Payments Audit

Check for:
	•	Whether Stripe keys are in test or live mode
	•	Whether the code references paymentIntents or charges
	•	Whether users could trigger payments
	•	Whether personal bank account info is visible or misconfigured
	•	Whether receipts or invoices are generated incorrectly

⸻

8. Footer & Public Content Audit

Identify:
	•	Every piece of legal wording in the footer
	•	AI-generated placeholder text
	•	Inaccurate legal claims
	•	Missing required details:
	•	Legal name of sole trader
	•	Business address
	•	Contact email

⸻

9. Security Audit

For the whole project:
	•	Missing HTTPS enforcement
	•	Misconfigured CORS
	•	Missing security headers
	•	Missing secrets rotation
	•	Missing user session storage security
	•	Any code with access to admin-level actions
	•	Credential exposure
	•	Upload/file path vulnerabilities

⸻

10. Output Format

Deliver your results in this exact structure:
	1.	Summary of all findings
	2.	Critical Risks (must fix before beta)
	3.	High Risks
	4.	Medium Risks
	5.	Low Risks
	6.	Missing Legal Documents
	7.	Missing GDPR Requirements
	8.	Technical Security Issues
	9.	Data Flow Diagram (text version)
	10.	File-by-file analysis
	11.	Final Compliance Checklist for Beta Readiness

Every item must include:
	•	Filepath
	•	Description of issue
	•	Severity
	•	Recommendation to fix

⸻

🎯 FINAL LINE OF THE DIRECTIVE (important)

Do not guess or hallucinate. Only report findings directly from project files, code, and config present in this workspace.
