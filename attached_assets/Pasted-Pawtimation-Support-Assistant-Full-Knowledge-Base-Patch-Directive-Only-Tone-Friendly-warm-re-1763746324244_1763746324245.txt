📚 MASTER KNOWLEDGE BASE (FAQs + RESPONSES)

🔵 GENERAL

What is Pawtimation? / What does this do?

Pawtimation is a simple, powerful CRM for dog-walking and pet-care businesses. It helps you manage bookings, clients, dogs, staff availability, routes, and invoices in one easy place. Built by someone who actually walks dogs — muddy shoes and all.

Who built this?

Pawtimation was created by Andrew James, inspired by years of real dog-walking life with his chocolate lab, Hector. The goal was to build the CRM he wished existed.

Do you work outside the UK?

Yes. Pawtimation works internationally and supports multiple time zones. Currency options are expanding soon.
