ADMIN BOOKINGS WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS (PLAIN TEXT)
	1.	Bookings list page

	•	Replace the current bare table with a proper card-wrapped table (same style as invoices).
	•	Make “Create booking” a floating button OR aligned right, consistent with other pages.
	•	Add status shades/colours (Booked, Completed, Cancelled).
	•	Add row hover highlight for clarity.
	•	Add pagination if list exceeds 20 bookings.

	2.	Bookings edit modal
This modal is already good but tighten it:

	•	Make all section titles consistent (Service location, Dog selection, Service, Time, Staff assignment, Status).
	•	Add horizontal dividers between sections for readability.
	•	Reduce Google Maps iframe height to match the MapTiler map height.
	•	Replace Google Maps preview with the same MapTiler component used on client profile.
	•	Ensure route generation button is visible only for walk-type services.
	•	Add “View booking in client profile” link top-right.

	3.	Bookings creation flow

	•	Reuse the edit booking modal for creating new bookings.
	•	After saving, automatically redirect back to bookings list with a toast: “Booking created”.

	4.	Booking conflict warnings

	•	Style the alerts consistently with the yellow alert styling used in other areas.
	•	For staff conflicts, show count and a “view conflicting bookings” link.

MAP FIX — UNIFY MAP COMPONENT FOR CLIENT PROFILE AND BOOKING EDIT

Currently:
	•	Client profile uses MapTiler map (react-leaflet).
	•	Booking edit uses a Google Maps iframe.

Directive:
Replace the Google Maps iframe in the admin booking edit modal with the existing MapTiler map component used on the client profile page.

Steps:
	1.	Import the same Map component used for client location (LazyMap or Map.jsx).
	2.	Replace the iframe block inside EditBookingModal with the unified Map component.
	3.	Pass lat/lng from the booking.
	4.	Keep the marker and “Open in Google Maps” link.
	5.	Match height to 300px for consistent layout.
	6.	Ensure onChangeLocation callback still works if location editing is allowed.

Outcome:
All maps in the system look identical, same styling, same tiles, same UX.
