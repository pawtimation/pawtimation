PAWTIMATION BETA ONBOARDING & AUTOMATION DIAGNOSTIC (FOR REPLIT)

Replit — please answer every question clearly.
This is NOT a request to build anything.
This is a discovery audit to establish what already exists.

	•	Do they receive a welcome email?
	•	Does the system give them a guided tour?
	•	Does a “first login modal” appear?
	•	Is there a checklist or step-by-step wizard?
	•	Is anything triggered in the background (settings defaults, service templates, etc.)?
