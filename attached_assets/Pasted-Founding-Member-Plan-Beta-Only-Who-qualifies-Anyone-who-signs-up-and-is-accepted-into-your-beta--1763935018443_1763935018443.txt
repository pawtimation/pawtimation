Founding Member Plan (Beta Only)
Who qualifies?

Anyone who signs up and is accepted into your beta before January 1st.

What they get:

Exclusive Founding Member price:
£19/month forever (instead of £29–£39 future pricing)

Full, unlimited access.

No price increases. Ever.

This discount is locked to their business.

Why it works:

They feel privileged.

It feels rare + valuable.

It doesn't give away the product for free.

It gives a clear transition after beta ends.

You're not on the hook for lifetime freebies.
