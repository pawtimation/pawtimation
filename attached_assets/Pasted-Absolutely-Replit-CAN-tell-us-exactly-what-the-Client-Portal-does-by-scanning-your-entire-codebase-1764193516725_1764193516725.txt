Absolutely — Replit CAN tell us exactly what the Client Portal does by scanning your entire codebase.

Here is the Replit AI Directive you should paste directly into Replit so it can identify every feature available to Client Portal Users (pet owners).

This will give us the definitive list to lock down the Privacy Policy, Terms, DPIA, ROPA, and lawful basis.
