GLOBAL DATE AND TIME PICKER REPLACEMENT (APP-WIDE)

Replace every date and time selection UI in the entire app with two unified components:
TimePicker
DatePicker

TIMEPICKER RULES
Component name: TimePicker
Brand style: Pawtimation green accents, rounded edges, soft grey background, premium feel.
12h or 24h mode is controlled by a single admin branding toggle. Default is 12h UK. All time pickers follow this setting.
Times shown in 15 minute increments only.
Valid range is 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM.
Visual rules:
– Rounded container
– Soft shadow
– Large comfortable row height
– Scrollable list
– Selected time has full width green highlight
– Disabled times appear greyed
Mobile shows wheel style. Desktop shows dropdown list. Both use same design tokens.
Replace every single existing time dropdown:
Admin bookings (start and end time)
Admin working hours
Admin staff availability
Admin staff weekly calendar changes
Client booking requests
Staff job start/end logging
Anywhere a time select currently exists
Remove all existing select boxes and legacy time pickers.

DATEPICKER RULES
Component name: DatePicker
Brand style: same green, rounded edges, premium lightweight calendar.
Default month view: simple grid with minimal UI.
Can swipe on mobile or click arrows on desktop to change month.
Today is highlighted with a soft grey outline.
Selected date is highlighted in Pawtimation green.
Prevent selecting past dates for:
– new bookings
– client requests
Allow selecting past dates for:
– editing existing bookings
– admin overrides
Calendar must show dot indicators for days that have existing bookings for that client, staff member, or business.
Single date mode only. No range mode required.
Must be keyboard accessible.

COMBINED DATETIME PICKER
When both date and time are required on one screen (example: creating a booking, editing a booking, staff availability windows), show DatePicker first and TimePicker directly below it as one unified block with consistent spacing.
Both components are required fields unless explicitly overridden.
Validation rules shared across all screens:
– End time must be after start time.
– If outside business hours, show “Outside Opening Hours” in grey but still selectable for admins.
– If staff has conflicts, show conflict warning beneath the picker.

APPLY EVERYWHERE
Replace all old HTML select menus for times and dates anywhere in the app, admin or client or staff.
Use the same two components everywhere so the entire product is visually and functionally consistent.
