SECTION 1 — Branding Objective

Unify all branding across the entire Pawtimation platform (homepage, admin, staff, client, PDFs, mobile, chat widget, footer, navbar, login screens) while maintaining the real Pawtimation brand assets and ensuring NO stretched, distorted, or recoloured logos.

Brand must feel:
Premium / Confident / Clean / Modern / Professional / UK Pet-Tech

⸻

SECTION 2 — What MUST NOT Happen

Replit MUST NOT:
	1.	Change ANY colours unless specifically instructed.
	2.	Stretch, squash, recolour, blur, crop, compress, or replace the paw logo.
	3.	Substitute your PNG with its own SVG or auto-vectorised version.
	4.	Replace any brand elements with Tailwind defaults.
	5.	Guess colours or generate new styles.
	6.	Alter layout, spacing, UX, or component structure.
	7.	Touch product flows (client, staff, admin).
	8.	Touch your hero image unless directed.

This is brand update ONLY, not a redesign.

SECTION 3 — Pawtimation Brand Assets (Source of Truth)

Replit MUST use ONLY these assets:

1. Official Paw Icon (Primary Logo Mark)

File already uploaded by user:
/mnt/data/C8259BA8-42FB-4155-A8C8-E03691B41431.jpeg

Replit MUST convert this PNG to a clean SVG (exactly matching shape + colour).
The SVG must retain:
	•	Same silhouette
	•	Same stroke weight
	•	Same geometry
	•	Same proportions

Do NOT stylise or “improve” it.

2. Official Brand Colours

Replit MUST use this palette as the single source of truth:

Primary Brand Colour
Teal Paw:
HEX #008080

Secondary Colours
Warm Graphite:
HEX #2A2D34

Soft Cloud Grey:
HEX #F5F7FA

Mint Accent:
HEX #A8E6CF

Error Red:
HEX #E63946

Success Green:
HEX #4CAF50

Typography Colour
Deep Slate:
HEX #1C1E21

3. Brand Font

SECTION 4 — Required Deliverables

Replit MUST perform all of the following:

⸻

A) Replace All Existing Paw Icons & Logos With the Official SVG

Replit must:
	1.	Generate the SVG (from PNG, not auto-generated weird blob).
	2.	Insert the SVG into:
	•	Homepage hero
	•	Homepage navbar
	•	All admin layouts
	•	All client mobile layouts
	•	All staff mobile layouts
	•	PDF invoices
	•	Loading screen (if exists)
	•	Chat widget
	•	Footer
	3.	Ensure uniform size rules:
	•	Logo in navbars = 32×32px
	•	Mobile header logo = 28×28px
	•	PDF logo = 48×48px
	•	Homepage hero logo = 60×60px

NO stretching. NO colour changes.

⸻

B) Apply Primary Colour #008080 Globally

Replit must ensure that:
	•	Buttons, links, CTAs, toggles, selected states, active nav-items, calendar highlights, and primary accents use #008080 only.
	•	No other teal shades are allowed.
	•	Secondary UI elements may use graphite or mint as per palette.

⸻

C) Ensure Chat Widget Uses Correct Logo + Proper Background Contrast

Replit MUST:
	•	Replace the chat icon with the official paw SVG, white-filled if needed.
	•	Use a teal circular background behind the paw so it displays cleanly.
	•	Ensure accessibility contrast passes WCAG.

⸻

D) Homepage Branding Corrections

Replit must:
	1.	Correct logo sizing (currently distorted).
	2.	Correct the sub-headline spacing and typography.
	3.	Replace placeholder images with brand-consistent assets (if needed).
	4.	Ensure Hector image is NOT over-saturated or oversized.
	5.	Tone down the vibrancy so Hector does not overpower the hero section.

Do not remove Hector unless instructed.

⸻

E) Footer Branding Rebuild

Replit must implement a new, clean footer:

Columns:
	1.	Product
	2.	Company
	3.	Legal
	4.	Branding
	5.	Founder

All footer links must be dummy placeholders but structured (no 404s or blank states).

Include:
Pawtimation — Pet Care Automation
Using official logo + colours.

⸻

F) Uniform Mobile Theming

Replit MUST apply branding to:
	•	Staff navigation bars
	•	Client bottom tab bars
	•	Mobile page headers
	•	Highlighted states
	•	Buttons / forms / cards
	•	The little badge colours

All must use the palette above.

⸻

G) DO NOT TOUCH ANY PRODUCT FLOWS

No breaking logic.
No modifying routes.
No changing component behaviour.
No refactoring.
No updates to services, jobs, bookings, clients, staff, invoices, or calendars.

This is a visual brand update ONLY.
