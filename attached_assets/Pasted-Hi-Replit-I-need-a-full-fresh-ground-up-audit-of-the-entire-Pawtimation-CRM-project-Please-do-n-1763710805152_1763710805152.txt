Hi Replit — I need a full, fresh, ground-up audit of the entire Pawtimation CRM project.
Please do not assume any prior state, and do not rely on past patches.
Start this as if you have never seen the code before.

What I need from you:

============================================================
1️⃣ FULL CODEBASE AUDIT (ALL APPS, ALL ROUTES, ALL UI)

Please inspect every folder and every file in:
	•	apps/api
	•	apps/web
	•	apps/mobile
	•	shared utilities
	•	any remaining legacy folders

For each of the following, tell me:
	•	What actually exists
	•	What is unused
	•	What is broken
	•	What is duplicated
	•	What is out-of-date
	•	What workflows are complete vs incomplete
	•	What APIs have mismatched frontend/backend behaviour
	•	What screens are still referencing old logic

This should be a ground-truth technical audit, not based on assumptions.

============================================================
2️⃣ END-TO-END WORKFLOW VERIFICATION

Please run and validate the full flow for all three roles:

Admin
	1.	Login
	2.	Create client
	3.	Create dog
	4.	Create services
	5.	Create staff
	6.	Admin booking creation
	7.	Client booking approval
	8.	Staff assignment
	9.	Admin calendar visibility
	10.	Completion → Invoice items
	11.	Invoice generation
	12.	PDF generation
	13.	Mark as paid
	14.	Revenue dashboard

Staff
	1.	Staff login
	2.	View assigned bookings
	3.	View availability
	4.	Update availability
	5.	View job details
	6.	Complete a job
	7.	Calendar behaviour
	8.	Notifications (if implemented)

Client
	1.	Client login
	2.	View upcoming jobs
	3.	Book a service
	4.	Edit/cancel booking (if allowed)
	5.	View invoices
	6.	Receive updates
	7.	Profile page
	8.	Dog management
	9.	Map-based experience (if implemented)

Please identify any broken, missing, or inconsistent behaviour.

============================================================
3️⃣ CONFIRM ALL API ROUTES ARE CORRECTLY MAPPED

Please verify and document:
	•	All backend routes
	•	Their params and inputs
	•	Their outputs
	•	Their connection to frontend components
	•	Any duplicate or unused endpoints
	•	Any route that exists but is not used
	•	Any route needed but not created

Document all mismatches between UI and API.

============================================================
4️⃣ CONFIRM RECENT PATCH WORK

Please re-check everything from the last major set of patches, including:
	•	Booking form dropdown population
	•	Staff assignment logic
	•	Job lifecycle (PENDING → BOOKED → COMPLETED)
	•	Invoice itemization
	•	Invoice generation & PDF output
	•	Dashboard stats accuracy
	•	Branding settings
	•	Mobile staff and mobile client UX
	•	Time picker unification
	•	Recurring booking behaviour
	•	Any references to removed old code

If anything is partially implemented or still broken, document it clearly.

============================================================
5️⃣ UX/UI CONSISTENCY AUDIT

Please review and report on:
	•	Admin UI consistency
	•	Staff UI consistency (many screens seemed outdated)
	•	Client UI (booking screen looked wrong)
	•	Mobile screens across all roles
	•	Branding consistency
	•	Navigation logic
	•	Visual hierarchy and layout
	•	Duplicated screens or mismatched designs
	•	Responsiveness
	•	Missing loading/error states

Provide a breakdown of what should be improved.

============================================================
6️⃣ GLOBAL SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK

Please evaluate:
	•	Performance bottlenecks
	•	Data model consistency
	•	Authentication flow
	•	Role-based routing
	•	State management
	•	Error handling
	•	Real-time updates (socket)
	•	File structure organization
	•	Technical debt
	•	Missing functionality
	•	Any red flags that would affect beta testers

============================================================
7️⃣ FINAL OUTPUT

At the end, please produce:
	1.	A clear Current State Summary
	2.	A list of All Working Features
	3.	A list of Broken / Missing / Incorrect Features
	4.	A list of Recommended Fixes (prioritized)
	5.	A Beta Readiness Score
	6.	A Roadmap to Reach Beta Stability
	7.	A Roadmap for Post-Beta Development

Please be extremely detailed — treat this as a professional engineering audit.

Do not assume anything.
Discover everything.
Explain everything.

Thank you.
