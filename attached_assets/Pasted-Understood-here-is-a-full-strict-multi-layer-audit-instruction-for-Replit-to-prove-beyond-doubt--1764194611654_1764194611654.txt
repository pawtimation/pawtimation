Understood — here is a full, strict, multi-layer audit instruction for Replit to prove beyond doubt that:
	•	All mapping is disabled
	•	No geocoding is initiated
	•	No routing is initiated
	•	No location data is processed
	•	No mapping UI renders
	•	No API keys are used
	•	No lat/lng comes from anywhere
	•	No logs or background tasks touch mapping logic

This is the most complete and thorough mapping-disabled audit you will find anywhere.
It will catch EVERYTHING.

🟦 REPLIT AI DIRECTIVE — FULL MAPPING DISABLEMENT AUDIT

Objective:
Verify that all mapping, geocoding, routing, and location-based processing have been FULLY disabled across the entire Pawtimation codebase.
This includes backend, frontend, shared utils, cron jobs, and external calls.

⸻

🔍 1. SCAN FOR ANY ACTIVE MAPPING CODE PATHS

Search the ENTIRE repository for ANY of the following keywords:

map
maps
mapping
route
routing
geocode
geocoding
lat
lng
latitude
longitude
directions
distance
OpenRouteService
MapTiler
Leaflet
react-leaflet
Polyline
Navigation
OSRM
geo
tile

Return:
	•	File path
	•	Line number
	•	5 lines before
	•	5 lines after
	•	Whether mapping is still active
	•	Whether ENABLE_MAPS guards are applied
	•	Whether unreachable code still triggers external requests

⸻

🟥 2. Confirm NO BACKEND GEOCODING OR ROUTING CAN BEGIN

Specifically check:
	•	apps/api/src/utils/geocode*.js
	•	apps/api/src/utils/routing*.js
	•	apps/api/src/routes/*
	•	apps/api/src/services/*
	•	Any external API clients

For ANY geocoding or routing logic, confirm:

✔ guarded BEFORE execution

if (!process.env.ENABLE_MAPS) return ...

✔ no API calls to ANY external provider

✔ no axios/fetch with mapping URLs

✔ no “skipped = false” results

✔ no latent background tasks

Return:
	•	Whether ANY backend function can still call geocoding
	•	Whether ANY external URL contains “route”, “geo”, or “tile”

⸻

🟦 3. Confirm CLIENT ADDRESS UPDATES NEVER TRIGGER MAPPING

Inspect:
	•	client update routes
	•	business update routes
	•	staff update routes
	•	job/booking creation routes

Ensure:

✔ geocode() is NEVER called when ENABLE_MAPS=false

✔ lat/lng fields are ALWAYS null or untouched

Return:
	•	All occurrences of address update code
	•	Confirm mapping is bypassed BEFORE geocode is referenced

⸻

🟩 4. FRONTEND: Confirm ALL MAP UI is hidden or unreachable

Scan:
	•	apps/web/src/components
	•	apps/web/src/screens/client
	•	apps/web/src/screens/staff
	•	apps/web/src/screens/admin

Check ANY component named:
	•	Map
	•	MapView
	•	MapContainer
	•	RouteMap
	•	MapPreview
	•	DogMap
	•	BookingMap

For each:

✔ Confirm wrapped in if (!ENABLE_MAPS) return null

✔ Confirm it renders NOTHING when maps disabled

✔ Confirm there are NO fallback map renders

✔ Confirm no auto-imported map libraries run

Return:
	•	Paths of ALL UI map components
	•	Whether they are properly disabled

⸻

🟥 5. CONFIRM NO LAT/LNG ENTERS THE SYSTEM ANYWHERE

Scan:
	•	Database inserts
	•	Updates
	•	Serialisers
	•	mappers
	•	any client.lat or client.lng logic

For each occurrence:

Confirm that with ENABLE_MAPS=false:
	•	lat = null
	•	lng = null
	•	OR lat/lng untouched (original null stays)

Return any places where lat/lng could “slip through”.

⸻

🟦 6. Confirm no mapping-related cookies, localStorage, or UI state exists

Scan the frontend for:
	•	mapping state
	•	navigation flags
	•	route UI
	•	location cookies
	•	any “mapEnabled” flags other than ENABLE_MAPS

Return any relevant storage items.

⸻

🟩 7. Confirm NO EXTERNAL MAPPING APIs ARE LOADED

Search for:
	•	OpenRouteService URLs
	•	MapTiler URLs
	•	Leaflet imports
	•	react-leaflet imports
	•	tile servers
	•	bounding boxes
	•	polyline decoding

Return:
	•	Whether ANY script or module loads mapping functionality
	•	Whether tile providers are referenced
	•	Whether external mapping API keys are loaded into the app

⸻

🟥 8. Confirm all mapping-related ENV keys are unused when disabled

Search for:
	•	VITE_MAP_KEY
	•	MAPTILER_API_KEY
	•	OPENROUTESERVICE_KEY

For each:

✔ Confirm no code path loads or uses them when ENABLE_MAPS=false

⸻

🟦 9. Confirm logs do NOT contain mapping traces

Scan logging code for:
	•	“route”
	•	“geo”
	•	“lat”
	•	“lng”
	•	“mapping”

Confirm:
	•	no logging of coordinates
	•	no logging of mapping tasks
	•	no debug logs with routes

⸻
