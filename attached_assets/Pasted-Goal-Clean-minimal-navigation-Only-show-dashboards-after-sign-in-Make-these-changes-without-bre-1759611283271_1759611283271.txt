Goal: Clean, minimal navigation. Only show dashboards after sign-in.

Make these changes without breaking existing API calls or env vars.

1) Header / Navigation
- Replace current nav with: [Home] [Community] [Account]
- Remove “Owners” and “Companions” from the header.
- Keep logo + version badge as is.

2) Landing (Home)
- Keep the hero + short copy.
- Replace owner/companion sections with TWO simple cards:
  - “I’m a Pet Owner”  → buttons: [Sign in] [Create account]
  - “I’m a Pet Companion” → buttons: [Sign in] [Create account]
- IMPORTANT: No management buttons on Home (no “Auto-book”, “Manage my pets”, “Edit my profile”, etc.). Those live only in dashboards after auth.
- If a user is already signed in, show a single button on each card: [Open my dashboard] which deep-links based on role.

3) Auth & Role Routing
- Keep existing auth mechanism.
- After successful sign-in/sign-up, route by role:
  - Owner  → /dashboard/owner
  - Companion → /dashboard/companion
  - If a user has both roles, show a chooser screen: /dashboard/choose with two buttons.
- Protect /dashboard/* routes with an auth guard. Unauthed users are redirected to /signin with a returnTo param.

4) Dashboards (move features here)
- /dashboard/owner should contain the items that were previously on Home:
  - “Auto-book a Companion”
  - “Manage my pets”
  - “My Circle” (invites, roster, DMs)
  - “Community chat” (public channels + DMs)
- /dashboard/companion should contain the items that were previously on the companion marketing page:
  - “Edit my profile”
  - “Preview my public page”
  - Services, availability, document upload (as you already built)

5) Account area (top-right)
- Route: /account
- Sections (cards):
  - Profile (photo, name, role badge, location; links to “Manage my pets” for owners or “Edit my profile” for companions)
  - Subscription & Billing (Free/Plus/Premium, upgrade/downgrade CTA)
  - Preferences & Notifications (basic toggles now; placeholders for premium toggles greyed with 🔒)
  - AI Chat History (list, paw-up/paw-down; escalations email to hello@pawtimation.co.uk)
  - Support & Feedback (FAQ, contact form -> email)
  - Logout
- If user is on Free, show greyed premium items with “Upgrade to unlock”.

6) Community
- Keep route /community.
- Tabs: [Public chat] [Events] (Events can be a placeholder list for now).
- Do not show owner/companion admin actions here; this page is global.

7) Remove or Redirect old pages
- /owners and /companions:
  - Option A: convert to thin marketing pages with only [Sign in] [Create account] that redirect to /dashboard after auth.
  - Option B (preferred): 301 redirect both to / (Home).

8) DM rooms (keep from earlier patch)
- Deterministic room ids: dm_<ownerId>_<friendId>
- “Message” button in “My Circle” opens the correct DM.

9) Environment / Deployment
- Do NOT change VITE_API_BASE or any server ports.
- Keep health checks and existing API URLs intact.

10) QA checklist (must pass before finishing)
- Header shows exactly: Home • Community • Account.
- Home shows only the two role cards with Sign in / Create account.
- After sign-in, owners land on /dashboard/owner; companions on /dashboard/companion.
- Old buttons (Auto-book, Manage my pets, My Circle, Edit my profile, Preview public) are visible ONLY in their dashboards.
- /account loads and shows the sections with premium items greyed on Free.
- /community works; no owner/companion admin controls appear there.
- Unauthed visit to /dashboard/* redirects to /signin and returns after login.
- Existing API endpoints still respond; no 404s introduced.

Deliverables:
- Updated NavBar component
- Updated Home page
- New/updated routes: /dashboard/owner, /dashboard/companion, /dashboard/choose, /account, /community
- Redirects for /owners and /companions
- Basic tests or manual QA notes covering the checklist above
