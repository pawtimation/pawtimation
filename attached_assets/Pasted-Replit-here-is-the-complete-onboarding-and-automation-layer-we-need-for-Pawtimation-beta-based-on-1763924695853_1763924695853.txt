Replit — here is the complete onboarding and automation layer we need for Pawtimation beta, based on the diagnostic audit.

DO NOT build anything already listed as “exists.”
Only build what is currently missing.

————————————
	1.	BUILD: Admin First-Time Onboarding Wizard
(dashboard overlay visible only on first login)

Steps:
	1.	Add services
	2.	Add staff
	3.	Add clients
	4.	Create first booking
	5.	Complete a booking
	6.	Generate an invoice
	7.	Mark invoice paid

Each step should:
	•	detect completion automatically
	•	show “Step X complete”
	•	move to next step

————————————
	2.	BUILD: Staff Automated Onboarding
When a staff member is created:

	•	send automatic invite email
	•	include temporary password
	•	require password reset at first login
	•	show “getting started” modal on first login
	•	instructions on confirming/declining jobs

————————————
	3.	BUILD: Client Automated Onboarding
When a client is created:

	•	send login email
	•	include login link
	•	show first-time “Welcome” modal in client portal
	•	explain bookings, calendar, invoices

————————————
	4.	BUILD: Booking & Invoice Email Triggers
Implement the following:

• Booking confirmed
• Booking reminder (24h before)
• Booking cancelled
• Invoice generated
• Invoice overdue
• Payment received

Templates already exist in infrastructure — wire them up.

————————————
	5.	BUILD: In-App Help Center
Add a simple persistent “Help & Guides” button linking to:

• Getting started
• How to add clients/staff
• How to create bookings
• How invoicing works
• How staff portal works
• How client portal works

————————————
	6.	BUILD: Progress Tracking (essential for beta)
Add internal tracking per business for:

• Has added services
• Has added staff
• Has added clients
• Has created booking
• Has completed booking
• Has generated invoice
• Has received payment

Expose as a simple data object in super admin dashboard.

————————————
	7.	INTEGRATE: WalkthroughModal.jsx
This file already exists but is unused.
Connect it to the admin side to power the onboarding wizard.

————————————
	8.	ENSURE: No duplication with existing automations
Use existing email flows (welcome, trial, founder follow-up)
Only add missing automations listed above.

————————————

Once complete, provide:
• File paths
• Trigger points
• Component names
• Email templates
• New endpoints (if any)
• How to test each onboarding step

————————————

End of request.
