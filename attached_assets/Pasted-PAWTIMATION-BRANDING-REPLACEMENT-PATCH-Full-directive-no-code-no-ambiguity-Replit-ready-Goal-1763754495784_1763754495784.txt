PAWTIMATION BRANDING REPLACEMENT PATCH

(Full directive — no code, no ambiguity, Replit-ready)

Goal:
Replace every paw icon in the entire product with one consistent teal vector logo, derived from the uploaded PNG:

Source reference file:
/mnt/data/C8259BA8-42FB-4155-A8C8-E03691B41431.jpeg (your teal paw)
(If Replit needs a filename, instruct them to convert this to paw.svg.)

🎯 REQUIRED OUTCOME

Replit must:
	1.	Create a clean vector SVG version of my supplied paw (identical colour, shape, proportions).
	2.	Use this SVG as the sole branding icon everywhere across:
	•	Homepage (top-left)
	•	Admin navigation
	•	Staff portal floating paw button
	•	Client portal floating paw button
	•	Login page
	•	Footer sections
	•	Favicon + browser tab icon
	•	Any placeholder paw icons in screenshots or UI cards
	3.	Fix inconsistencies in teal colour and enforce:
	•	Primary brand colour = the exact teal extracted from the uploaded paw PNG.
	4.	Ensure the chat widget uses:
	•	White outline stroke around the paw icon
	•	OR
	•	Use the SVG in monochrome black or charcoal
(Whichever looks cleaner on a white bubble — allow Replit to choose the more professional option.)
	5.	Remove any previous paw artwork, mismatched greens, or off-brand shapes.

📌 SPECIFIC REPLACEMENTS

Replit must systematically replace:

1. App Logo (global)
	•	Replace current logo image with the new paw.svg followed by “Pawtimation”.
	•	Ensure spacing and alignment match modern SaaS standards.

2. Floating Paw Button (Client & Staff Portals)

Replace the current circular FAB icon with:
	•	White circle
	•	Teal paw SVG inside
	•	High-resolution SVG (no PNGs)
	•	Slight drop shadow for visibility

3. Favicon & Browser Icons

Generate from SVG:
	•	favicon.ico
	•	favicon-16.png
	•	favicon-32.png
	•	apple-touch-icon.png
	•	site.webmanifest

4. Homepage Hero Illustrations

Any paw motif (background, overlays) must use the new SVG at reduced opacity,
NOT the old neon green versions.

5. Footer Branding

Replace any placeholder or default icons with the new paw.svg.

6. Remove All Previous Paw Assets

Delete or de-reference any of these:
	•	Old teal variants
	•	Flat paw PNGs used earlier
	•	Icon fonts with paw symbols
	•	Temporary illustrations containing paws

⸻

🎨 BRAND COLOUR LOCK-IN

Extract the teal hex from the uploaded PNG and apply it globally:
	•	Primary brand colour = exact teal from the uploaded paw
	•	Do not generate a new shade
	•	Do not approximate
	•	All buttons, accents, and call-to-action highlights must match this exact colour

Replit must replace hard-coded greens in CSS with the extracted teal.

⸻

💬 CHAT WIDGET FIX

The chat widget currently has a white bubble background, so the teal paw disappears.

Replit must handle this as follows:

Option A (Preferred)

Add a 2px white outline stroke around the teal SVG paw icon.

Option B

Use a charcoal-grey monochrome version of the paw for the widget specifically.

Replit may choose whichever looks cleaner in the UI.

⸻

📎 FILE CREATION REQUIRED

Replit must:
	•	Export paw.svg (vector extraction from uploaded PNG)
	•	Place in appropriate global assets folder (e.g. /public/brand/paw.svg)
	•	Convert into needed favicon formats
	•	Replace all imports throughout frontend
