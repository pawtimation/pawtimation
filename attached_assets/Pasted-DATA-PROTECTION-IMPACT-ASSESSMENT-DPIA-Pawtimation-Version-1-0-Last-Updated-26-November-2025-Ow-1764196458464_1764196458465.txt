Data is collected:
	•	directly from businesses, staff and clients
	•	automatically during authentication and use

All data is stored in a managed PostgreSQL database (Neon) hosted within Replit’s infrastructure.

3.3 Data Transmission

Data is transmitted over HTTPS with TLS 1.2+.

3.4 Data Retention

Defined in the Pawtimation Privacy Policy, summarised:
	•	operational records: active + 12 months
	•	invoices: 7 years
	•	logs: 30–90 days
	•	photos: active + 12 months
	•	beta data: deleted at beta conclusion

3.5 Data Deletion

Deletion requests are handled via platform tools or controller instructions.
Business owners may request deletion of their entire tenant data.

7. Risks Identified

This section identifies risks to individuals’ rights and freedoms.

7.1 Data Security Risks
	•	Unauthorised access to personal data
	•	Weak or compromised authentication
	•	Server vulnerabilities
	•	Data leakage via logs
	•	Insufficient role-based controls

7.2 Data Accuracy Risks
	•	Outdated customer information
	•	Incorrect pet or booking details
	•	User-entered errors

7.3 Data Transfer Risks
	•	Transfers to US-based processors
	•	Reliance on SCCs and UK Addendum

7.4 User Behaviour Risks
	•	Staff misusing client information
	•	Businesses entering excessive data
	•	Users uploading inappropriate content

7.5 Retention Risks
	•	Excessive retention of dormant accounts
	•	Storage of irrelevant or legacy records

7.6 Operational Beta Risks
	•	Downtime or data inconsistency
	•	Bugs causing data exposure
	•	Unintended feature behaviour

7.7 Mapping/Location Risks (Mitigated)
	•	Collection of GPS data
	•	Geocoding of addresses
	•	Location-based profiling
	•	Exposure of sensitive movement patterns

These risks are eliminated due to mapping features being fully disabled.

8. Measures to Address Risks

This section details the technical and organisational measures implemented.

8.1 Authentication and Access Control
	•	Password hashing
	•	JWT-based authentication
	•	Role-based access control
	•	Business-level data isolation
	•	Session expiry controls

8.2 Encryption and Security
	•	HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
	•	AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
	•	HSTS
	•	Strong Content Security Policy
	•	Strict CORS configuration
	•	API rate limiting
	•	Sanitised logs

8.3 Infrastructure
	•	Managed hosting via Replit
	•	Managed PostgreSQL via Neon
	•	Secure object storage for media
	•	Regular dependency updates
	•	Automated monitoring and alerts

8.4 Organisational Controls
	•	Staff/contractor confidentiality obligations
	•	Internal access restrictions
	•	Clear data handling procedures

8.5 Mapping/Geolocation Protective Measures

Mapping functionality, including:
	•	geocoding
	•	routing
	•	GPS collection
	•	map rendering
	•	tile server requests

has been disabled at:
	•	code level
	•	backend API level
	•	UI level
	•	CSP level
	•	environment variable level
	•	database level

This fully removes location-related risks.

8.6 Data Retention Controls
	•	Automated deletion for expired accounts
	•	Log retention limits
	•	Scheduled removal of beta-phase data
	•	Financial records retained for legal purposes only

9. Risk Assessment Summary

Risk Level	Before Mitigation	After Mitigation
Data breach	High	Low
Unauthorised access	High	Low
Incorrect data entry	Medium	Medium (user training required)
International transfers	Medium	Low (SCCs + UK Addendum)
Excessive retention	Medium	Low
Location-based risk	Medium	Eliminated (features disabled)
Beta instability	Medium	Medium

Residual risk is acceptable and proportionate to the purpose of the platform.

10. Consultations

No external consultations were required.
Internal product, technical and compliance review has been performed.

Should mapping features be introduced in future versions, an additional DPIA will be undertaken.

11. Conclusions

Pawtimation has:
	•	clearly defined purposes
	•	strong security controls
	•	appropriate documentation
	•	transparent processing practices
