INVOICE PDF GENERATION — FULL SPEC

GOAL

Implement a modern, branded PDF invoice generator for Pawtimation.
Invoices should look professionally designed, clean, and ready to send to clients.

Important:
PDF should NOT contain “Paid / Unpaid”.
The web UI will show status instead — the PDF is always an unpaid request for payment.
