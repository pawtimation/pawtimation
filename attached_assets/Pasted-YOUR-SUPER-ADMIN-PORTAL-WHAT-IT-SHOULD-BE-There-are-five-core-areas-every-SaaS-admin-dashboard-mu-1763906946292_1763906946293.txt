YOUR SUPER ADMIN PORTAL — WHAT IT SHOULD BE

There are five core areas every SaaS admin dashboard must have:

⸻

1️⃣ Global Business Metrics — “The Platform Health Panel”

This appears at the top of your super admin home:

Platform Overview
	•	Total businesses
	•	Active businesses (logged in last 7 days)
	•	Total staff users
	•	Total clients
	•	Total dogs
	•	Total bookings (all-time)
	•	Bookings last 7 days
	•	Bookings today
	•	Platform-wide revenue (if you’re using payment integration)
	•	Avg business size (walkers per company)
	•	Avg client count

These are KPIs for your entire company.

⸻

2️⃣ Operational Alerts — “What needs attention?”

A panel showing:

⚠️ System Issues
	•	Failed walk assignments
	•	Failed notifications (email / push / WhatsApp)
	•	Overlapping bookings
	•	Failed GPS tracking starts/ends
	•	Timezone mismatch issues

🐞 Bug Reports (auto + user)
	•	Client-reported issues
	•	Staff-reported issues
	•	Automatic app errors/exceptions

🔧 Required Admin Actions
	•	Businesses missing billing setup
	•	Businesses with invalid staff data
	•	Businesses with out-of-date app versions

This becomes your “actionable operations” list.

⸻

3️⃣ Business Directory — “All Businesses” dashboard

Instead of the empty table you have now, this should be:

Business Table Columns
	•	Business name
	•	Owner name
	•	Staff count
	•	Client count
	•	Walk count
	•	Last login
	•	Status (active / trial / suspended)
	•	Actions: View → Impersonate → Settings

Yes: Impersonation mode should be included for support.

⸻

4️⃣ System Logs — Reworked

Your current logs list is empty and unusable.

You need structured log types:

Log Categories
	•	Authentication logs
	•	Booking lifecycle events
	•	Notification logs
	•	Payment logs (Stripe, etc.)
	•	Staff location tracking logs
	•	Error logs
	•	Admin actions

You also need:
	•	date range picker
	•	severity levels
	•	keyword search
	•	download as CSV

⸻

5️⃣ User Feedback Portal — Reworked

Your current screen is fine structurally, but useless without improvements.

What needs adding:
	•	Filter by business
	•	Filter by domain (Dogs, Calendar, Bookings, Payments)
	•	Severity tagging
	•	Status flow: New → Investigating → Fixed → Declined
	•	“Add internal notes”
	•	Merge duplicate feedback

⸻

🔥 THIS IS WHAT YOUR SUPER ADMIN DASHBOARD SHOULD LOOK LIKE

Top Summary Cards
	•	Total Businesses
	•	Active Businesses
	•	Bookings Today
	•	Bookings This Week
	•	Total Revenue (if using payments)
	•	Errors Today
	•	Support Tickets Open

Graph Panels
	•	Bookings over time (platform-wide)
	•	Active users vs. inactive users
	•	Notification delivery success rate
	•	Revenue trend (if payments enabled)

Operational Feed

Real-time feed (most recent first):
	•	Business created
	•	Staff added
	•	Booking created
	•	Booking modified
	•	Booking cancelled
	•	Payment succeeded
	•	Error: (details)
	•	Crash detected in XXXXX

This lets you monitor your entire ecosystem live.

🎨 STYLE CLEANUP

Replace red banners

The red header in “User Feedback” is too alarming and looks like an error.
Use neutral grey or your brand teal.

Add back navigation consistency

Your “Back to Dashboard” is red — shouldn’t be.

Add spacing at the top

Currently, the content starts too immediately below the header.
