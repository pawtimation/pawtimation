Absolutely — this is exactly the right move.
If Replit answers these questions, I can reconstruct every missing piece of context, understand what code exists, what workflows are implemented, and what is still in placeholder mode.

Below is a very thorough, structured list of questions you can paste directly into Replit.

When you get Replit’s responses

Paste them back here.

I will:
	•	reconstruct exactly what is built
	•	identify what belongs to admin vs staff
	•	remove accidental mobile UIs
	•	fix incorrect routing
	•	design a clean workflow map
	•	build the missing functionality in the right order
	•	ensure no more wasted patches or misalignment
