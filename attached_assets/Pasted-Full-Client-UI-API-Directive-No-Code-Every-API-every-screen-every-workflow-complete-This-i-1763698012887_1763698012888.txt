Full Client UI & API Directive (No Code)

Every API, every screen, every workflow — complete.

2. Dogs
	•	GET /dogs/by-client/:clientId
	•	POST /dogs/create
	•	POST /dogs/:dogId/update
	•	POST /dogs/:dogId/delete (if allowed)

“Please implement the full Client UI system using the directive above (Client UI Full Spec v2). This includes all required screens, all API bindings, branding support, messaging, notifications, dog management, booking workflows, invoice flows, route generation, device registration and push notification preferences. Do not deliver partial updates — return only after everything listed is fully implemented, tested end-to-end, and verified with real sample data.”
