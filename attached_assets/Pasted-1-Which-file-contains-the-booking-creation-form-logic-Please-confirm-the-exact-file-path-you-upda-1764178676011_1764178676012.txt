1. Which file contains the booking creation form logic?

Please confirm the exact file path you updated for the client auto-fill fix:
	•	apps/web/src/components/BookingFormModal.jsx
	•	apps/web/src/screens/AdminBookingCreate.jsx
	•	OR another file?

(We need to confirm you edited the correct component.)

⸻

2. In that file, is clientId included in the React form state?

Specifically, please confirm yes or no:
	•	Does the form have:
setValue("clientId", ...) anywhere?
	•	Is there a hidden field like:
<input type="hidden" {...register("clientId")} />?

⸻

3. When a dog is selected, do you map the dog to its owner?

Please confirm whether the dog selection handler includes something like:

const dog = dogs.find(d => d.id === dogId);
setValue("clientId", dog.clientId);


⸻

4. Right before the POST request, what does the booking payload look like?

Please add:

console.log("Booking payload:", formData);

Then tell me EXACTLY what appears in the browser console when submitting.

⸻

5. Is the POST request to /api/bookings including clientId in the Network tab?

Yes or no.

If yes → backend problem
If no → frontend missing field

⸻

6. Did you test the fix in the Replit dev environment BEFORE publishing?

If yes:
	•	Did the dev environment booking form include clientId?
	•	Did it successfully create a booking?

⸻

7. When publishing, did the updated file appear in the deployment logs?

(We need to confirm the fix was actually included in the build.)

⸻

8. Is there more than one booking form component in the codebase?

Sometimes systems have:
	•	Admin booking form
	•	Edit booking form
	•	Staff-created booking form
We need to confirm the correct one was edited.

⸻

9. Was the client dropdown intentionally hidden, or accidentally removed?

If it was removed:
	•	Was it replaced with auto-inference?
	•	Or was it removed without adding auto-linking?

⸻

10. Does each dog in the database have a valid clientId?

Ask Replit to verify using SQL:

SELECT id, name, client_id FROM dogs;
