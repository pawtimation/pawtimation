PAWTIMATION — FINAL LAUNCH PLAN
	1.	Confirm Replit has completed all remaining patch fixes
Ask Replit: “Have all items in the final audit checklist now passed with no remaining blockers?”

If they say yes → proceed.
If any item is missing → I will generate the smallest patch required.
	2.	Enable production mode
Ask Replit: “Is NODE_ENV=production already active and confirmed?”

If yes → good.
If no → activate it.
	3.	Confirm CORS whitelist
Ask Replit: “Is ALLOWED_ORIGINS now locked to only my domains (dashboard + marketing site)?”

Must be yes.
If not → fix immediately.
	4.	Confirm JWT secret is new and secure
Ask Replit: “Confirm JWT_SECRET is not default and is cryptographically strong.”

Must be yes.
	5.	Hard reboot the entire platform
Ask Replit: “Perform a full cold restart (not hot reload) of both frontend and backend.”

This guarantees everything runs on real production configs.
	6.	Run a live end-to-end test as YOU
Use a fresh browser or incognito for each role:

Admin login → create client → create staff → create booking → staff logs in → completes job → client logs in → views booking → views map → views invoice.

If every step succeeds → move on.
	7.	Run a real Stripe payment
Use your own card to:

• Start a trial
• Upgrade to paid
• Check the Stripe dashboard
• Confirm webhook updated planStatus

If this works once, it will work always.
	8.	Run a real Resend email test
Trigger all email types:

• Create a fake beta tester → confirm welcome
• Activate them → confirm founder email
• Create trial → confirm trial email
• Trigger trial-ending email by modifying trialEndsAt in DB (Replit can assist)
• Confirm daily feedback summary arrives at 21:00 UK time

If all emails send once, the pipeline is real.
	9.	Test file uploads
Upload:

• A dog photo
• A staff headshot
• A walk photo/video

Verify these rules hold:

• Correct visibility per role
• Stored in correct folder paths
• No cross-business leak
• Loads instantly on small devices
	10.	Run a real maps test
Create a job → generate a route → check the following:

• Mobile dragging works
• Waypoints save
• Route reloads
• Client sees read-only map

If this works once → maps are stable.
	11.	Test overdue invoices logic
Create an invoice → set dueDate manually to yesterday → confirm:

• UI shows overdue
• Overdue total updates
• Reminders run (if enabled)
• Owner Portal analytics reflect it
	12.	Validate the super admin portal
Log in as SUPER_ADMIN:

• Masquerade into a business
• Reset password
• Extend trial
• Suspend business
• Check logs show every action

When this passes → you have true platform-owner control.
	13.	Run the full feedback + daily summary test
Submit feedback from:

• Admin
• Staff
• Client
• Widget
• Support panel

Check the owner portal → feedback dashboard → all items appear
At 21:00 UK → daily summary arrives
This confirms telemetry is alive.
	14.	Confirm scalability
Ask Replit: “Does the owner portal handle 100 businesses without slowdown?”

If yes → you’re scale-ready.
	15.	Clear all console warnings
Ask Replit: “Confirm there are zero frontend and zero backend warnings in production build.”

Cleaner = more trust when real customers arrive.
	16.	Prepare your marketing site and CTA
Make sure:

• Homepage CTA is “Start Your Free Trial”
• Pricing plans display correctly
• Links point to the correct onboarding flows
• Legal pages (privacy, terms, data protection) work
	17.	Enable real CDN (optional but recommended)
Ask Replit: “Enable object storage CDN for images and media.”

This gives instant fast loading worldwide.
Not required, but nice to activate.
	18.	Announce launch
You can now officially launch Pawtimation.
