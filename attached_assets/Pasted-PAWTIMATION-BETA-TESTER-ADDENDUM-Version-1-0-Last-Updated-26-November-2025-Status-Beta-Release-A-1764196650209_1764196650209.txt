Last Updated: 26 November 2025
Status: Beta Release Addendum
This Addendum forms part of the Pawtimation Terms of Service.

This Addendum applies to all users (businesses, staff, and clients) who access the Pawtimation platform during its beta testing phase.
By using the platform, you agree to this Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service.

⸻

1. Purpose of the Beta Programme

The purpose of this beta programme is to allow early access to the Pawtimation platform so that users can:
	•	evaluate functionality
	•	identify issues, defects and usability concerns
	•	submit feedback to improve the final release version

The platform is provided at no charge during the beta period.

⸻

2. Pre-Release Status

The beta version:
	•	is not the final product
	•	may contain defects, bugs or incomplete features
	•	may be updated frequently and without notice
	•	may experience downtime or instability
	•	may change significantly before full release
	•	may include temporary or disabled features
	•	does not include guaranteed service levels

Users acknowledge that reliability may not meet production-grade standards.

⸻

3. Scope of Use

Beta users may use the platform:
	•	for real business operations, or
	•	for testing environments, training and evaluation

However, users accept that:
	•	the Service may not operate continuously
	•	planned or unplanned outages may occur
	•	data entered during beta may be migrated, altered or removed

The platform should not be used as a sole operational system for critical services during beta.

4. No Fees and No Billing During Beta

No subscription fees or charges apply during the beta period.

Stripe and payment functions are not fully enabled.
No payments will be collected or processed.

5. Test Data and Real Data

Users may enter real customer, staff, and pet data into the platform.
All such data is processed in accordance with:
	•	the Privacy Policy
	•	the Data Protection Statement
	•	the DPA (where applicable)

Pawtimation does not require users to use anonymised or synthetic data, but caution is recommended due to beta instability.

6. Data Integrity and Data Loss Risk

Users acknowledge that:
	•	data may change during updates
	•	database structures may be modified
	•	bugs may cause data inconsistency
	•	backups may not be fully comprehensive

Pawtimation will take reasonable steps to protect data, but no guarantee is provided during beta.

Users should maintain their own backups of critical operational information.

⸻

7. Feedback and Reporting

Beta users agree to:
	•	report defects, issues or errors
	•	provide feedback voluntarily
	•	allow Pawtimation to use anonymised feedback to improve the platform

Feedback does not grant the user any ownership or intellectual property rights over improvements.

	•	GPS collection
	•	geocoding
