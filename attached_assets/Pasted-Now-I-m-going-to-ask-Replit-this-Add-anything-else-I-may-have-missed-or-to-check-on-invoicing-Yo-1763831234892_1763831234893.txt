Now I’m going to ask Replit this. Add anything else I may have missed or to check on invoicing :

Your checklist is excellent — it shows you understand almost every moving piece of your SaaS now. I have only 6 more questions I recommend adding so Replit can’t wiggle out of anything.

These cover file uploads, media storage, permissions, data retention, billing safety, and crash-recovery — things most founders forget until they blow up later.

Below is a clean, copy-paste-able list including your 10 sections + my 6 additions.

This is the final QA list before real businesses touch your platform.

Send this EXACT list to Replit — nothing missing, nothing overlapping, nothing redundant.

Once they respond, I will review their answers line-by-line and tell you what is safe and what still needs tightening.
