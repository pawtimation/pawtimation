Title: Companion onboarding sprint (stable, minimal, no payments)

Goal:
Focus next 30 days on recruiting and stabilising Companion accounts. Make signup smooth, profiles complete, availability clear, and opportunities visible. No payments needed yet.

Tasks:
1) Companion signup hardening
   - /companion/start: clear explainer (earnings, expectations, verification later).
   - /auth/signup captures: name, email, mobile (optional), location (Beaconsfield prefilled, editable), role='companion'.
   - After signup → /companion checklist.

2) Companion checklist (/companion/checklist)
   - Steps with progress:
     [ ] Upload photo
     [ ] Add short bio (min 80 chars)
     [ ] Set service types + base prices (walk 30/60, day care, drop-in)
     [ ] Set availability calendar (at least 3 slots)
     [ ] ID/Insurance upload (optional now; mark as “Pending verification”)
   - Each item links to the right screen; show % complete.

3) Profile & Services (/companion/profile)
   - Required fields enforced; friendly error states.
   - Public page preview (/c/:handle) with “Coming soon” badge.

4) Availability (/companion/calendar)
   - Month view + quick “Add slot” for next 2 weekends.
   - Save to memory; show success toast.

5) Opportunities (/companion/opps)
   - List of mocked “AI-matched” requests pulled from /ai/match with companion’s location/time; include Accept/Decline (no-op).
   - Badge “Preview mode — live bookings coming soon”.

6) Messages baseline
   - /messages loads; can open DM rooms; deterministic id support retained.

7) Stability pass
   - Every Companion page returns a UI (no blank hangs).
   - Missing data uses friendly placeholders.
   - Errors are caught and surfaced as toasts, not white screens.

Acceptance:
- A new user can sign up as Companion and reach /companion/checklist immediately.
- They can complete each checklist item and see progress hit 100%.
- Profile/Calendar/Opportunities load without console errors.
- /messages opens and sends a basic DM.
- No paid features required; nothing asks for Stripe.
