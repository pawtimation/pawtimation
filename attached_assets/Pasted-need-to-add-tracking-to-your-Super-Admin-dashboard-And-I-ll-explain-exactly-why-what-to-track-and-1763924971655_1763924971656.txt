need to add tracking to your Super Admin dashboard.
And I’ll explain exactly why, what to track, and how simple it actually is.

⸻

✅ WHY YOU NEED TRACKING IN SUPER ADMIN

Right now, you have:
	•	15+ beta testers coming
	•	No visibility into what they’ve actually done
	•	No way of knowing who is stuck
	•	No way of knowing who is using the platform properly
	•	No way of knowing which features are breaking silently

Right now, you can only guess or wait for someone to message you.

That’s dangerous for a beta and creates massive manual work.

Super Admin tracking solves this by giving you:

✔ A live view of every business’s progress
✔ Instant alerts when onboarding stalls
✔ Data to prioritise fixes
✔ A clear proof of usage before billing in January
✔ Zero need for you to chase testers manually

Without this, you’ll spend hours DM’ing testers, asking what they’ve done, trying to guess what’s not working.

With it, you can run beta in 10 minutes per day.

🟦 WHAT YOU SHOULD TRACK (MINIMUM VIABLE SET)

You do not need anything complicated.

You only need to track whether a business has completed the critical steps.

Each business should track these booleans:
	1.	servicesAdded
	2.	staffAdded
	3.	clientsAdded
	4.	firstBookingCreated
	5.	firstBookingCompleted
	6.	firstInvoiceGenerated
	7.	firstPaymentReceived

Optional but useful:
	8.	mobileLoginUsed
	9.	clientPortalViewed
	10.	staffPortalViewed

That’s it.

Each one is triggered automatically by existing actions in the system.

🟩 HOW IT SHOULD LOOK IN SUPER ADMIN

Inside your Super Admin UI, add a new panel:

Business Onboarding Progress

For each business:
	•	Name
	•	Owner
	•	Joined date
	•	% complete (based on 7 steps)
	•	A little progress bar
	•	Coloured status

Examples:

Pawfect Walks — 85% — Green
Happy Hounds — 14% — Red (no staff added)
Dog Days — 43% — Amber (no clients yet)

This lets you instantly see:
	•	Who’s struggling
	•	Who’s active
	•	Who needs nudging
	•	Who is likely to convert in January

⸻

🟨 DO YOU NEED IT BEFORE BETA?

YES
Otherwise you’ll have:
	•	Zero visibility
	•	Beta testers quietly getting stuck
	•	No clue if a feature is broken
	•	No way to know if onboarding even works
	•	No way to measure product-market fit
	•	Tons of manual work

This is the single most important part of running beta efficiently.

⸻

🟧 HOW HARD IS IT TO ADD?

Very easy.

Replit only needs to:
	•	Add 7 boolean fields to the business record
	•	Trigger them on normal system events
	•	Show them in super admin dashboard

Total dev time: 2–4 hours.

Massive impact for you.

⸻

🟪 WHAT TO TELL REPLIT (COPY/PASTE)**

Say this to them:

⸻

Please add onboarding progress tracking for each business so I can monitor beta adoption.
Each business should have the following boolean fields:

servicesAdded
staffAdded
clientsAdded
firstBookingCreated
firstBookingCompleted
firstInvoiceGenerated
firstPaymentReceived

Each one should automatically set to true when the relevant action happens in the system.
Then, in the Super Admin dashboard, add a panel called “Business Onboarding Progress” showing:
	•	Business name
	•	Owner name
	•	Joined date
	•	A % completion number
	•	A progress bar
	•	A colour code (red <30%, amber 30–70%, green >70%)
	•	Which items are still incomplete

This will let me monitor beta tester adoption without manually checking each account.
