SECTION 1 — Staff App (Mobile-First)

The staff experience must be simplified to the following:

⸻

1. Replace the current Staff Navigation Menu with 4 items only:

Bottom Nav (mobile style):
	1.	Today
	2.	Calendar
	3.	Messages
	4.	Settings

Remove:
	•	Dashboard
	•	My Jobs
	•	Availability (move into Settings)
	•	Any placeholder or duplicate screens

⸻

2. TODAY SCREEN (NEW PRIMARY STAFF HOME)

This is the main staff screen.

Shows:
	•	Next job at the top
	•	All of today’s jobs in chronological order
	•	Each job card includes:
	•	Client name
	•	Dog(s)
	•	Service name + duration
	•	Start time
	•	Address (tap → open maps)
	•	Notes indicator
	•	Status badge (BOOKED / EN ROUTE / STARTED / COMPLETED)

Actions on each job:
	•	Start Job
	•	Message Client
	•	Navigate (opens Apple/Google Maps)
	•	Mark Complete

Status updates must hit existing endpoints:
	•	/bookings/:id/update
	•	/messages/*

Remove all placeholder text.

⸻

3. CALENDAR (REPLACE CURRENT CALENDAR)

A very simple week selector only:

Layout:
	•	Top: Week selector (Mon–Sun)
	•	Tap a day → list of jobs for that day (same card style as Today)

No grid.
No heavy calendar.
Mobile list only.

⸻

4. JOB DETAIL SCREEN

Consolidate all job information.

Must include:
	•	Client name, phone, address
	•	Dog profiles (name, breed, notes)
	•	Service details
	•	Start + end time
	•	Notes (client + admin internal)
	•	Uploaded photos (if any)
	•	Add note (for staff)
	•	Upload photo
	•	Status buttons (Start / Complete)

This screen should use existing data from /bookings/:id.

⸻

5. MESSAGES

Staff needs:
	•	All client conversations
	•	Booking-linked message threads
	•	Unread indicators
	•	Ability to send messages

This already ties to:
	•	addBusinessMessage
	•	listMessagesForBooking
	•	listMessagesForInbox

⸻

6. SETTINGS (NEW CONSOLIDATED SCREEN)

Settings includes:

Profile
	•	Staff name
	•	Phone
	•	Profile picture

Notifications
	•	Push notifications toggle
	•	WhatsApp alerts toggle
	•	Email alerts toggle

Availability
	•	Weekly recurring availability editor
	•	“Add day off” overrides
	•	Show conflicts (“You are already booked at this time”)

Logout

Remove the old standalone Availability page.

⸻

🐾 SECTION 2 — Client App (Mobile-First)

Clients need a beautiful, simple, clean UI.

⸻

1. Client Navigation (mobile tab bar)
	1.	Home (next booking + quick actions)
	2.	Bookings (upcoming + past)
	3.	Dogs
	4.	Messages
	5.	Settings

⸻

2. HOME (Main client screen)

Show:
	•	Next upcoming booking
	•	Status (Pending → Booked → Completed)
	•	Assigned walker picture + name
	•	“Message” button
	•	“Open in Maps”
	•	Quick actions:
	•	Book again
	•	Add new booking
	•	View invoices

⸻

3. BOOKINGS

Split into tabs:
	•	Upcoming
	•	Past

Each booking shows:
	•	Date & time
	•	Dogs
	•	Walker assigned
	•	Status
	•	Price
	•	Actions:
	•	Cancel (if pending/booked)
	•	Edit (if pending)
	•	Message
	•	Rebook
	•	View invoice (if completed)

⸻

4. DOGS

Client manages:
	•	Add dog
	•	Edit dog
	•	Breed, age, temperament
	•	Vet info
	•	Behaviours (good/bad)
	•	Photo

This ties to /dogs/* endpoints.

⸻

5. MESSAGES

Same messaging UI as staff, but with the client as senderRole=“client”.

Needs unread indicators and last message preview.

⸻

6. SETTINGS

Includes:
	•	Profile
	•	Address (home location for walking routes)
	•	Notification preferences
	•	WhatsApp alerts toggle
	•	Apple/Android push toggle
	•	Payment methods (future premium)
	•	Privacy & terms
	•	Logout
