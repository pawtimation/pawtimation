You must apply the updates below only to the marketing homepage.
Do NOT alter any admin/staff/client UI, routing, authentication, APIs, functionality, or component behaviour.

🎨 1. Correct Pawtimation Branding (IMPORTANT – CURRENT BRANDING IS WRONG)

Replace all homepage branding colors, icons and accents with:

Official Pawtimation Brand
	•	Primary brand color: #008080 (Teal)
Use this for:
	•	Logo mark
	•	Buttons
	•	Highlight elements
	•	Icons
	•	Checkmarks
	•	Hover accents
	•	Secondary color: #0F172A (Navy/Slate) — for headings
	•	Light background shade: #F1FAFA — optional subtle panels

Requirements:
	•	Remove any green, mint, turquoise, or off-teal tones that do not match #008080.
	•	Button on homepage should be:
	•	Primary CTA: Solid teal #008080
	•	Secondary CTA: Outline with teal border

⚠️ The current paw logo color is incorrect — update it to #008080.

🐶 2. Fix Hero Image of Hector

Current issue:
	•	Too large
	•	Overly vibrant compared to subtle brand
	•	Pulls attention away from the headline

Fix:
	•	Keep the image but tone down saturation by 15–25%
	•	Add a slight color overlay tint using #F1FAFA at ~40–50% opacity
	•	Apply a subtle drop shadow like existing cards
	•	Ensure the image does not exceed 420px width on desktop
	•	Ensure mobile version crops properly (max-height 260px)

Place the image using the version at:
/mnt/data/5D4A391F-0770-4589-8C98-18382F259B6A.jpeg

🖼️ 3. Replace the Three Feature Illustrations (Admin / Staff / Client)

The current 3 cards:
	•	look low quality
	•	don’t match brand
	•	are inconsistent in style
	•	middle image is especially poor

Replace them with new clean, minimal illustrations:

Style requirements:
	•	Flat, simple, product-UI-style illustrations (not cartoon)
	•	Colors must be limited to:
	•	Teal #008080
	•	Slate #0F172A
	•	Light mint background #F1FAFA
	•	Gray neutrals (#E5E7EB etc.)
	•	Rounded corners & slight shadow like your dashboards
	•	Each illustration should clearly represent:
	1.	Admin Dashboard
	2.	Staff Mobile App
	3.	Client Booking Portal

Use the images I uploaded here — they are the files you should use:

New image files:
	•	Admin Dashboard: /mnt/data/C700BCD2-67C7-415A-84AD-2EB15E7720CA.jpeg
	•	Staff App: /mnt/data/01A104C3-AFE9-48BC-B98F-BAACBBE16779.jpeg
	•	Client Booking: /mnt/data/4E2544AE-CF78-4B45-A006-507A163D0318.jpeg

Requirements:
	•	Ensure all 3 images share identical dimensions & aspect ratio
	•	All 3 must sit perfectly aligned in the grid
	•	All shadows, radii and borders must match each other

🔠 4. Typography & Spacing

Do NOT change fonts globally.
Only adjust homepage spacing:
	•	Increase top padding of hero to pt-24 (desktop) / pt-12 (mobile)
	•	Reduce giant headline size by 10–15% (currently too oversized on mobile)
	•	Add slightly more spacing between paragraphs and CTAs

⸻

🧼 5. Stability Requirements

Do NOT:
	•	Touch any admin/staff/client pages
	•	Touch auth, dashboards, or routes
	•	Modify Tailwind config
	•	Modify API base paths
	•	Change logic, state, or database fetches
	•	Change any of the marketing text

Only modify:
	•	Home page
	•	Hero section visuals
	•	Feature illustrations
	•	Branding colors
	•	Image handling
	•	Styling

⸻
