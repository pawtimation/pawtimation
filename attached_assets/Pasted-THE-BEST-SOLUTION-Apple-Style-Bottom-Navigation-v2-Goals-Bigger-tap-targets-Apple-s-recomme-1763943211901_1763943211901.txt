THE BEST SOLUTION: “Apple-Style Bottom Navigation v2”
🎯 Goals:

Bigger tap targets (Apple’s recommended 44–48px minimum height)

More visual weight and clarity

More breathing room around each icon

Modern iOS-style rounded-rectangle touch areas

Keep the 4-tab layout you already have

🔥 Recommended Style Update (Simple + Very Effective)
1. Increase button height

From ~50px → 70–80px

This improves tappability dramatically.

2. Add soft rounded "capsule" backgrounds behind active tabs

Apple uses subtle blobs, not hard squares.

Example:

Active tab = soft, pill-shaped background in your teal brand colour at 10–15% opacity

Inactive tabs = transparent

3. Increase icon size

From ~20px → 26–28px

4. Increase label font size

From 12px → 14–15px, medium weight.

5. Space icon + label vertically

Example:

gap: 6px;
padding-top: 6px;

6. Add subtle drop shadow

Like iOS native tab bars:

box-shadow: 0 -2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);

💎 Visual Style Inspiration

Think:

iOS:

Large tap areas

Soft focus

Big icons

Clear labels

Rounded selection background

This amps up usability, speed, and premium feel instantly across staff & client portals.

🧠 Why Not Expand to 5 Tabs?

Because:

4 items = ideal cognitive load

5 tabs = cramped, especially on older phones

You want FAST access without thinking

So we keep the 4, but make them iOS-premium.

🛠️ Implementation (React / Tailwind snippet)

This is what your upgrader would build:

<nav className="fixed bottom-0 w-full bg-white shadow-[0_-2px_6px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)] h-[80px] flex justify-around items-center">
  {tabs.map(tab => (
    <button
      key={tab.id}
      onClick={() => navigate(tab.href)}
      className={`
        flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-1 rounded-2xl px-4 py-2
        ${isActive(tab.href)
          ? "bg-teal-50 text-teal-600"
          : "text-gray-500"
        }
      `}
      style={{ minWidth: 80 }} // Larger target
    >
      <tab.icon size={28} />
      <span className="text-[14px] font-medium">{tab.label}</span>
    </button>
  ))}
</nav>


This gives you:

✔ Big icons
✔ Bigger hit zones
✔ Soft selected background
✔ Apple-style shadows
✔ Perfect mobile ergonomics
