The client booking page must NOT use any admin screens.

Right now the client “Book a Walk” page is showing the admin booking interface.
This must be removed entirely.

Directive:
	•	Detach the client booking route from all admin booking components.
	•	The client booking page must only use client-appropriate UI.

⸻

2️⃣ Replace the current booking form with the correct client version.

Clients should only see simple booking inputs.

Directive:
Client booking form must contain:
	•	Service
	•	Dog(s)
	•	Date
	•	Time
	•	Optional notes

Clients should not see:
	•	Staff
	•	Prices
	•	Durations
	•	Status dropdowns
	•	Admin-only options
	•	Any internal admin fields

⸻

3️⃣ Ensure the booking is created through the client booking flow.

The client booking should NOT call the admin booking system.

Directive:
	•	Client bookings must submit through the client booking API, not the admin booking API.
	•	All client bookings must be created with status = Pending.
	•	Clients should never be allowed to auto-create Booked jobs.

⸻

4️⃣ Use the client-safe version of the services list.

Clients should not see unpublished or admin-only services.

Directive:
	•	Ensure the services dropdown for clients uses the public services list.
	•	Only services marked visible to clients should appear.

⸻

5️⃣ After booking, client should land on their booking list.

Right now there is no clear confirmation flow.

Directive:
	•	After a successful booking, redirect the client to their bookings page.
	•	The new booking must be visible as Pending approval.

⸻

6️⃣ Ensure the client UI does NOT load admin layout, styling, or scripts.

The current page inherits admin styling, which is why it looks wrong.

Directive:
	•	The client booking page must only use client-side layout components.
	•	Remove any admin layout/styling dependencies from the client UI.

⸻

7️⃣ Ensure the booking flow works end-to-end.

Directive:
Replit must test:
	1.	Client logs in
	2.	Client books a walk
	3.	Booking appears in client bookings as Pending
	4.	Booking appears in admin pending approvals
	5.	Admin approves
	6.	Booking becomes Booked
	7.	Staff receives the job
	8.	Client sees the updated status

All screens must reflect the correct states.
