———————————————————————
DO NOT MODIFY ANY EXISTING BOOKING, CLIENT, STAFF, OR PAYMENT LOGIC.

Add the following functionality in an additive, safe way.
	1.	NEW BACKEND BEHAVIOUR — OVERDUE STATUS
The backend must calculate overdue status automatically, not the UI.
A new server-side property should be added when returning invoices:

• isOverdue = true if:
	•	status is not PAID
	•	dueDate < now()

• overdueDays = number of days overdue (0 if not overdue)

This must be computed in every invoice-related endpoint:
	•	GET /invoices/list
	•	GET /invoices/:id
	•	GET /invoices/client/:clientId
	•	GET /invoices/admin/:businessId

Do not add new database fields yet. Overdue is derived, not stored.
	2.	NEW API ENDPOINTS FOR FINANCIAL KPIs
Add a new admin-only endpoint:
GET /api/invoices/summary

The endpoint should return:
• totalInvoices
• totalPaidAmountCents
• totalUnpaidAmountCents
• totalOverdueAmountCents
• overdueInvoiceCount
• unpaidInvoiceCount
• paidInvoiceCount
• upcomingDueInvoices (count where dueDate is within next 7 days)

This endpoint powers dashboards and charts.
	3.	DAILY OVERDUE CHECK + REMINDER SYSTEM
Add a new scheduled job that runs once per day (e.g. 9am UK).

This job must:
• find all invoices where:
	•	status is not PAID
	•	dueDate < now()
• for each invoice:
	•	send a polite reminder email to the client
	•	only send 1 reminder every 48 hours (store in meta.lastReminderAt)
	•	do NOT send reminders for invoices older than 90 days

Email template:
Subject: Payment Reminder – Your Pawtimation Invoice

Body:
Hi {{clientName}},
This is a quick reminder that your invoice {{invoiceNumber}} for £{{amount}} is now overdue.
If you’ve already paid, thank you — you can ignore this message.

Otherwise, you can view or pay your invoice here:
{{paymentUrl}}
	4.	ENHANCED FINANCIAL CHARTS (INVOICES PAGE)
On the admin invoices screen, add two charts using the summary API:

Chart 1: Status Breakdown
• Paid
• Unpaid
• Overdue

Chart 2: Monthly Invoice Amounts
• Show total paid vs unpaid amounts per month
• Uses existing invoice.createdAt timestamps

Charts must be mobile-friendly and readable on small screens.
	5.	ENHANCED DASHBOARD CHARTS (MAIN ADMIN DASHBOARD)
On the main admin dashboard, add these KPIs using the new summary endpoint:

Top-level cards:
• Unpaid total (£)
• Overdue total (£)
• Paid this month (£)
• Upcoming due invoices (next 7 days)

Charts:
• Overdue invoices trend (last 6 months)
• Total revenue trend (paid invoices by month)
	6.	UI LABELS
Wherever an invoice is listed:
• If overdue, show a small red “OVERDUE” tag
• If due today, show an amber “Due Today” tag
• If due within next 7 days, show a warning “Due Soon”
	7.	NO BREAKING CHANGES
This patch must not modify:
• payment logic
• invoice creation logic
• PDF generation
• business plan restrictions
