MAPPING UX POLISH PATCH
(DO NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING SCHEDULING, BOOKING, STAFF OR CLIENT LOGIC)

Goal: Improve the dog-walking map experience to feel modern, smooth and professional without requiring premium map services.
	1.	MAP LIBRARY
Use the existing map library already installed. Do not replace it.
Just update styling, controls and UX.
	2.	WAYPOINT EXPERIENCE
Waypoints remain exactly as they are now but improve the interaction:

	•	When clicking to add a waypoint:
• Show a small pulse animation at the point.
• Auto-connect the waypoint to the previous one with a thin polyline.
	•	When dragging a waypoint:
• The polyline recalculates smoothly.
	•	When deleting a waypoint:
• Fade the point out smoothly instead of instantly disappearing.

	3.	LINE STYLING
Update the route polyline styling:

	•	Use slightly thicker line weight
	•	Slight transparency
	•	Rounded line joins
	•	Add optional shadow/glow for better visibility
	•	Do not change colours globally — use existing brand teal for routes.

	4.	MAP CONTROLS
Improve the map controls without changing libraries:

	•	Add zoom-in and zoom-out floating buttons bottom-left
	•	Add a simple “Re-centre on Start” button if the walker drags too far
	•	Add a “Clear Route” button that removes all waypoints
	•	Keep the UI minimal and clean

	5.	ROUTE PREVIEW
Before saving the walk route, show a small preview panel:

	•	Total distance (approximate using waypoint path)
	•	Estimated duration (basic average walking speed)
	•	Start and end points
This panel appears above the Save button.
Do not change saved data structure — keep current fields.

	6.	SAVE WORKFLOW
When user saves:

	•	Show a toast “Route saved”
	•	Keep them on the same screen
	•	Do not reload the page
	•	Do not alter booking data
	•	Do not add new required fields

	7.	MOBILE UX
Mapping must be fully useable on mobile:

	•	Make map container full-screen height with scroll disabled while open
	•	Make waypoints larger and easier to tap
	•	Keep confirmation buttons at bottom of screen
	•	Ensure dragging waypoints works on touch

	8.	PREMIUM FEATURE HANDLING
Do not restrict mapping behind premium yet.
This patch must not introduce tier checks or plan restrictions.
We are only polishing the current free route feature.

Later, when premium tiers are ready, restrictions can be added cleanly using existing plan flags.
	9.	PERFORMANCE NOTES

	•	Do not fetch unnecessary map tiles
	•	Keep waypoint operations client-side
	•	Do not introduce server-side pathfinding
	•	Avoid adding new external map API dependencies

	10.	ACCEPTANCE
After patch, the mapping UX should feel:

	•	Smoother
	•	More modern
	•	More intuitive
	•	More mobile-friendly
	•	Without changing backend logic
	•	Without adding required new fields
	•	Without breaking any current bookings or existing routes
