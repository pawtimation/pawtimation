THE GOAL

When a beta user says:

“Dashboard doesn’t work”

Your system should already have logged:
	•	What page they were on
	•	What API call failed
	•	What the error code was
	•	The error message
	•	The inputs they used
	•	The exact line in your code that threw
	•	Their browser, device, OS
	•	Their user ID
	•	Their business ID
	•	Timestamp
	•	Any related warnings that preceded the crash

THAT is what makes debugging almost instant.

And yes — we can implement all of this.

🔥 THE 3-PART SYSTEM YOU NEED

1️⃣ Backend Error Capture (The Most Important)

All walk creation, dog updates, invoice loads, admin dashboards, staff views — everything — already touches an API.

Add a global backend middleware and you’ll log EVERY failure automatically:
	•	401 unauthorized
	•	403 forbidden
	•	404 missing endpoint
	•	409 conflict
	•	422 validation problems
	•	500 internal server error
	•	Unexpected exceptions
	•	Slow API responses (>500ms)

Once installed, your Super Admin Dashboard instantly shows:
	•	Errors per endpoint
	•	Errors per business
	•	Errors per user
	•	Errors per day
	•	Failed API calls
	•	Performance issues

This alone solves 70% of debugging.

2️⃣ Frontend Error Capture (Catches UI problems backend can’t see)

Things like:
	•	React component crashes
	•	Buttons not working because of JS errors
	•	Network failures
	•	User sees blank screen
	•	Calendar not loading
	•	Dogs page empty
	•	Staff schedule freezes

With a global window error listener + fetch wrapper, you also capture:
	•	JavaScript runtime errors
	•	Promise rejections
	•	Failed data loads
	•	Incorrect component props
	•	Mobile browser issues
	•	Touch events errors

This means you’ll see:

TypeError: Cannot read property ‘dogs’ of undefined
Failed GET /api/staff/schedule — network timeout
Unhandled promise — calendar generation failed

These go straight into System Logs.

3️⃣ Auto-Aggregated Health Dashboard (for YOU ONLY)

This sits under “Super Admin → Overview” and tracks:

📈 System Health
	•	API uptime last 24h
	•	Average response time
	•	Number of failed API calls
	•	Number of frontend errors
	•	Slowest endpoints

🐞 Errors & Bugs
	•	New errors today
	•	401 / 403 / 404 / 500 counts
	•	Errors by user
	•	Errors by business
	•	Errors per page (Dogs, Booking, Calendar, Dashboard, etc.)
	•	Error trends (charts)

📲 User Friction
	•	Rage clicks
	•	Repeated form submission failures
	•	Users who get stuck on a page
	•	Users who abandon flows (e.g., add dog → form error → leave)

🔐 Auth Issues
	•	Failed logins
	•	Expired tokens
	•	Invalid sessions
	•	Unauthorized access attempts

💳 Billing Failures
	•	Failed renewals
	•	Overdue payments
	•	Expiring subscriptions
