What are you on about? I’m doing this audit now. I’ve moved on:

Absolutely — here is a clean, copy-friendly, fully text-only final audit checklist you can paste straight into Replit with zero formatting issues.

This is the FINAL PRODUCTION READINESS CHECKLIST, updated based on everything that has been done over the last 48 hours and all patches now in progress.

No boxes. No special formatting. No markdown. Just plain text.
