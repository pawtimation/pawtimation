Objective:
Prepare the codebase for new legal documents by replacing outdated files, removing duplicates, and ensuring correct routing, formatting, and footer linking.

⸻

1. GENERAL RULES

You must:
	1.	Search the entire workspace for any existing legal pages.
	2.	If a document already exists → overwrite it completely with the updated version.
	3.	If it does not exist → create a new file in the correct directory.
	4.	Ensure all legal pages are accessible through routes in the UI.
	5.	Update the Footer to ensure correct links to legal pages.
	6.	Remove ALL outdated, placeholder, AI-generated, or incomplete legal text.

⸻

2. TARGET FILE STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)

Ensure the following files exist in the React web app:

apps/web/src/screens/legal/Privacy.jsx
apps/web/src/screens/legal/Terms.jsx
apps/web/src/screens/legal/Cookies.jsx
apps/web/src/screens/legal/DataProtection.jsx
apps/web/src/screens/legal/BetaAgreement.jsx (NEW)

apps/web/src/components/Footer.jsx
apps/web/src/routes/legalRoutes.jsx (IF EXISTS)
apps/web/src/App.jsx (ensure routes point to legal pages)

If these folders don’t exist, create them.

⸻

3. FILE ACTIONS (REPLACE OR CREATE)

3.1 Replace or Create the following:
	•	Privacy.jsx → replace fully with new Privacy Policy
	•	Terms.jsx → replace fully with new Terms of Service
	•	Cookies.jsx → replace fully with updated Cookie Policy
	•	DataProtection.jsx → replace fully with updated Data Protection Statement
	•	Footer.jsx → update address + legal links

3.2 New files that MUST be created:
	•	BetaAgreement.jsx → new Beta User Addendum
	•	ThirdPartyProcessors.md → documentation folder (reference only)
	•	RetentionSchedule.md → documentation folder
	•	DPIA.md (internal) → docs/legal
	•	ROPA.md (internal) → docs/legal

If any of these files already exist → overwrite them.

⸻

4. UPDATE ROUTING

Ensure the React router includes routes for:

/legal/privacy
/legal/terms
/legal/cookies
/legal/data-protection
/legal/beta-agreement

If routes are handled in a dedicated file (e.g., legalRoutes.jsx), update it.
If routing is centralised in App.jsx, update there.

Each route should import the corresponding legal component.

⸻

5. UPDATE FOOTER (MANDATORY)

Search for Footer.jsx and update the legal section:
	•	Replace business address with:

Andrew James Beattie / Pawtimation  
Lytchett House  
13 Freeland Park  
Wareham Road  
Poole  
Dorset  
BH16 6FA  
United Kingdom

	•	Replace all old links with:

Privacy Policy → /legal/privacy
Terms of Service → /legal/terms
Cookie Policy → /legal/cookies
Data Protection → /legal/data-protection
Beta Agreement → /legal/beta-agreement

Ensure all links render properly and match router paths.

6. ENSURE GLOBAL REPLACEMENT OF OLD ADDRESS

Search and replace any address matching:
	•	“5 Charles Kidnee Way”
	•	“Stoke Mandeville”
	•	“HP22 3AA”
	•	Any partial match of the old lines

Replace with:

Andrew James Beattie / Pawtimation  
Lytchett House  
13 Freeland Park  
Wareham Road  
Poole  
Dorset  
BH16 6FA  
United Kingdom

Make sure formatting (line breaks) is preserved in JSX using <br /> where needed.

⸻

7. CLEANUP OLD DOCUMENTS

Search for and delete outdated copies of:
	•	PRIVACY.md
	•	TERMS.md
	•	owner_TOS
	•	ai-generated footer text
	•	any placeholder documents in /public, /assets, /docs, /static

If needed, move important references to /docs/legal.

⸻

8. NOTIFY ME OF ANY MANUAL UPDATES REQUIRED

After running this directive, output a summary including:
	•	Files replaced
	•	Files created
	•	Routing changes
	•	Footer updates
	•	Any files containing ambiguous or hardcoded legal text
	•	Any address-like strings that were not automatically replaced
