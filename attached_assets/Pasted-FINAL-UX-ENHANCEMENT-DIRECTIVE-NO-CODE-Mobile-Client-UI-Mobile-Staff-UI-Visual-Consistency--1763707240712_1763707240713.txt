FINAL UX ENHANCEMENT DIRECTIVE (NO CODE)

Mobile Client UI + Mobile Staff UI — Visual Consistency & Branding Alignment

Purpose:
Unify the visual appearance of the Client Mobile UI and Staff Mobile UI so both match the clean, modern design of the Admin Desktop UI.
No functional, logical, routing, or backend changes. This is visual/UI-only.

⸻

1. Global Branding Alignment Across Client & Staff Mobile

Apply consistent Pawtimation branding across all mobile screens:
	1.	Use the business primary colour (from Admin → Settings → Branding) for:
	•	Navigation highlights
	•	Primary buttons
	•	Active tab icons
	•	Calendar selection
	•	Page headers
	2.	Typography must follow the Admin UI scale:
	•	Page titles: 20–24px
	•	Section headings: 16–18px
	•	Body text: 14–16px
	•	Input labels: 12–14px (medium weight)
	3.	Use consistent backgrounds:
	•	Page background: soft neutral grey (#f7f8fa or similar)
	•	Cards: white with subtle shadow and rounded corners
	4.	Spacing system:
	•	24px screen padding
	•	16px spacing between major elements
	•	12px spacing inside card components

2. Unify Mobile Navigation Bar Design (Client & Staff)

Both apps must use a single, consistent bottom navigation style.

Navigation bar requirements:
	•	Slightly taller bar for easier mobile interaction
	•	Active tab uses the business primary colour
	•	Inactive tabs use neutral grey
	•	Icons must come from the same icon set across both apps
	•	Labels aligned identically beneath icons

Client tabs: Home, Bookings, Dogs, Messages, Settings
Staff tabs: Today, Calendar, Messages, Settings

No functional change. Visual alignment only.

3. Modernise All Mobile Screen Layouts

Clean and standardise the layout structure for both Client and Staff UIs.

Apply the following visual rules:
	•	Convert all content into card-style sections (matching Admin UI cards)
	•	Ensure consistent card height, padding, border radius, and shadows
	•	Align all headings left
	•	Add proper section spacing for visual separation

Empty state standard:

Replace plain text with consistent empty-state layout:
	•	Icon (light grey outline, 32–40px)
	•	Title line
	•	Subtext line
	•	Centered, neutral styling

Uniformity required across:
Bookings, Messages, Dashboard, Calendar, Availability, Dogs, etc.

⸻

4. Dashboard Harmonisation (Client & Staff)

Currently both dashboards use different layouts and spacing.
Unify them so the dashboards are visually consistent.

Requirements:
	•	Both dashboards must use the same card grid layout
	•	Same typography for titles and values
	•	Same spacing and alignment rules
	•	Same quick-action bar layout
	•	Both dashboards must visually resemble the Admin look and feel

No new functionality. Only appearance.

5. Standardise Page Headers

Implement a consistent header style across all mobile screens:
	•	Left-aligned title
	•	Optional subtitle below
	•	Uses business primary colour as an underline or accent
	•	Sticky header (remains visible when scrolling)

This applies to all screens:
Bookings, Messages, Settings, Calendar, Dogs, Today, Profile, Availability.

⸻

6. Optional Theme Application (If Simple)

If feasible without altering logic:
	•	Tint icons, focus states, and highlight elements using the business’s primary brand colour
	•	Apply the same theme to both Client Mobile and Staff Mobile

No functional changes.
Visual theming only.

Summary for Replit

This is a visual/UI overhaul only for:
	•	Client Mobile UI
	•	Staff Mobile UI

The goal is to ensure both experiences are:
	•	Visually consistent with each other
	•	Fully aligned with the Admin Desktop branding
	•	Professionally polished
	•	Clean, modern, and easy to navigate

No changes to backend, API calls, routing, or functional behaviour.
