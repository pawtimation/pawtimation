Alright — STOP.
This tells us something extremely important:

👉 This is NOT a frontend bug anymore.
👉 The backend is rejecting the request BEFORE the form can even be processed.

Which means…

🚨 The clientId problem is NOT in the booking form at all.

It’s in the API.

A frontend fix cannot fix a backend validation failure.

So now we diagnose the backend.

I need you to answer 4 questions so I can pinpoint the exact cause.

Copy/paste these EXACTLY into Replit (no changes):

🔍 PASTE THIS TO REPLIT — BACKEND DIAGNOSTICS FOR CLIENT ID BUG

We are still getting “Client ID required” even after the frontend fix.
This means the issue is now 100% backend-side.

Please answer these questions before making any changes:

1. Which backend endpoint is validating clientId?

Confirm the exact file + route handling booking creation:
	•	apps/api/src/routes/jobRoutes.js
OR
	•	apps/api/src/routes/bookings.js
OR
	•	another location?

Which function checks clientId?

⸻

2. Does the server allow bookings where clientId is inferred from dogId?

Backend should accept:
	•	clientId from payload
	•	OR clientId derived from selected dog

Does the backend currently accept only the first?

⸻

3. Does the backend booking creation API require “clientId” explicitly even when dogId is provided?

If yes, that is the real bug.

⸻

4. What does the backend receive in the POST body?

Check logs:

console.log("Create Booking Request Body:", req.body);

Does it show:

clientId: undefined

or

clientId: "some-id"

We need this screenshot.

⸻

5. After creation, does the backend response include clientId?

You said:

“fullBooking.clientId OR form.clientId”

Please confirm the CREATE response DOES contain:

{ "clientId": "xxx" }


⸻

6. Is there ANY logic that overwrites booking.clientId with null or undefined?

Search backend for:
	•	booking.clientId = null
	•	delete booking.clientId
	•	omit([...])
	•	validation strips

⸻

7. Does the backend block bookings where the dog’s owner doesn’t match clientId?

We need to confirm whether the backend requires:

clientId === dog.clientId

If yes, that is the failure.

⸻

✔️ After answering these, we will know the fix in under 3 minutes.

Do NOT let them apply random fixes.
We need answers first.

⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT REALITY CHECK

Since:
	•	frontend sent clientId
	•	backend responds “clientId required”

The backend did not receive or did not trust clientId.

That means one of two things is true:

Possibility A — The backend is stripping undefined fields

If clientId is '' (empty string), the backend validation will fail.

Possibility B — The backend validation is too strict

Some backends require:

clientId && clientId.length > 10

or reject empty strings.

Possibility C — The booking re-fetch after creation wipes out clientId

This is likely, and Replit’s fix wasn’t enough.

The frontend preserving clientId is irrelevant if the backend reload is missing the field.

⸻

⭐ To fix it once and for all:

We will require Replit to modify the backend so this ALWAYS works:
	•	If dogId is provided…
	•	Then backend will ALWAYS derive clientId from dog table
→ clientId never required in the request again

This is the correct long-term fix.

But first, we need the answers to those questions.
