1. Staff Calendar Must Display Assigned Jobs

The staff calendar currently loads forever because it isn’t receiving any job data.

What to implement:
	•	Connect the Staff Calendar to the same job data that the admin calendar receives.
	•	Filter the results so each staff member only sees their assigned jobs.
	•	Ensure jobs appear with correct start time, service name, and client details.

2. “My Jobs” Page Must Show Upcoming & Completed Jobs

The screen shows “no jobs” even though staff are assigned work.

What to implement:
	•	Pull all jobs assigned to the logged-in staff member.
	•	Display:
	•	Upcoming jobs
	•	Completed jobs
	•	Client & dog details
	•	Address & notes

⸻

3. Staff Availability Page Needs Full Functionality

The page loads but shows no interface or saved data.

What to implement:
	•	Weekly working hours (Mon–Sun start/end)
	•	Ability to add “days off”
	•	Ability to override specific dates (holiday, sickness)
	•	Save and load availability data properly
	•	Ensure availability is used later for staff auto-assignment

⸻

4. Staff Dashboard Must Show Real Data

At the moment it’s an empty placeholder.

What to implement:
	•	Next upcoming job
	•	Jobs today
	•	Jobs this week
	•	Total completed jobs
	•	Alerts (if any)

All data should come from the staff member’s assigned jobs.

5. Staff Settings Page Must Be Populated

Currently blank.

What to implement:
	•	Staff profile info (name, email, phone)
	•	Ability to update profile details
	•	Notification preferences (basic toggles for now)
	•	Placeholder for profile photo upload (future feature)

⸻

6. Permissions Check

Staff should only see what staff are allowed to see.

What to enforce:
	•	Staff must NOT see admin pages, client lists, invoices, business settings, or anything not related to their own work.
	•	Staff should ONLY access:
	•	Their dashboard
	•	Their calendar
	•	Their jobs
	•	Their availability
	•	Their settings

This ensures role-based access is correct for beta.

	1.	Admin assigns a job to staff
	2.	Staff logs in
	3.	Staff sees the job in:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Calendar
	•	My Jobs
	4.	Staff updates availability
	5.	Staff updates profile

All screens must be fully functional before marking this task complete.
